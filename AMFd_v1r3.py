1.x)
hey, welcome to the desktop version of AMF!
A lot of old commands have been stripped out like online, name? and other online things
i am porting this to desktop to allow for easier coding
the desktop platform will also be the main distribution platform so new updates will come here first
I am also drafting up a TOS for this game so for the meantime: NO UNAUTHORISED DISTRIBUTION
you are free to mod the game however you like though

This game was made by Devon Lim, Â© 2021
========================================================================================================================
Gameplay:

inventory ---> check your inventory

buyrm {num} ---> buy {num} raw material(s)
(1 raw material = 0.5 money)

buym1 {num} ---> buy {num} grade one raw materials
(1 grade 1 raw material = 10 money)

sw {num} ---> Make your workers produce {num} standard products
(5 raw material = 1 Standard product)

w1 {num} ---> Make your workers produce {num} Grade 1 products
(50 raw material + 1 Grade 1 raw material = 1 Grade 1 product)

sellsp {num} ---> sell {num} of standard products

sellg1p {num} ---> sell {num} of grade 1 products

moneyloan {num} ---> loan out {num} dollars 
(you must have less than 10000 dollars of debt to take out any more loans)
(loan increases by 3%[compound interest] with every production and buy command)
(keep your loan less than 10 times the amount of money you loaned from the bank since you were last debt-free)

loanpay {num} ---> pays back {num} dollars of your loan

========================================================================================================================
Misc:

help ---> brings up this screen

what's new? ---> prints what"s in the current version of the game

what's coming? ---> prints what to expect for future versions of the game

say <num> "<string>" ---> prints "<string>" <num> many times

save ---> does to the dicts what Ctrl + S does to stuff

WIPEMYDATAFORGOOD ---> the big red reset button

Greetings fellow comrade!
As you know, ever since the recession, our economy has been left in shambles.
